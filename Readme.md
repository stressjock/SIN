# SIN // STRUCTURES INTEGRATION NEXUS

### Tactical Information & Global Monitoring Interface

**SIN (Structures Integration Nexus)** is a high-visibility, browser-based terminal designed for real-time global monitoring. It combines live multi-sector time tracking, atmospheric data, and tri-tier intelligence feeds into a single, CRT-styled command interface.

---

## 🖥️ System Features

### 1. Sector Monitoring (Global Clock & Cam)

* **16 Integrated Sectors:** Pre-configured for strategic global hubs (London, Kyiv, Tehran, Hong Kong, etc.).
* **Live Cam Uplinks:** Instant access to pre-set or custom live video feeds for every sector.
* **Dynamic Time Logic:** Tracks local time with automated **DST (Daylight Savings Time)** status detection.

### 2. Atmospherics (Weather)

* **Real-time Metrics:** Displays temperature, wind speed, and conditions using localized coordinates.
* **WMO Integration:** Uses standardized World Meteorological Organization codes to provide detailed reports ranging from "Mainly Clear" to "Heavy Snow".

### 3. Regional Intel Report (News)

* **Prioritized Logic:** Intelligent news filtering that prioritizes data in three tiers:
1. **City-Specific News**.
2. **Country-Level Updates**.
3. **Aviation/Logistics Industry News**.



### 4. Tri-Stream Intelligence Crawl

Three independent, high-speed tickers provide a constant stream of global data:

* **INTEL (Yellow):** Focuses on military, geopolitics, and global conflict.
* **AVIATION (Orange):** Monitors aircraft, airlines, and logistics (Set to 20% reduced speed for readability).
* **FINANCE (Green):** Tracks global markets, GDP, and economic shifts.

## 🛠️ Configuration & Customization

The system is designed to be fully persistent and customizable via the **[ CONFIG ]** menu:

* **Aesthetic Control:** Change the hex-color of the UI Accent, Intel Scroll, Aviation Scroll, and Finance Scroll.
* **Sector Management:** Toggle specific cities on/off to declutter your display.
* **Custom Uplinks:** Update the live camera URLs for any sector.
* **Data Portability:** **Export** your entire setup to a `.json` file and **Import** it on any machine to restore your custom SIN environment.

## 📡 Technical Specifications

* **Platform:** Standalone HTML5 / JavaScript (No installation required).
* **Visuals:** CRT Scanline overlay effect with an all-caps terminal aesthetic.
* **Data Sources:**
* **Weather:** Open-Meteo API (Refreshes every 15 minutes).
* **News/Intel:** GDELT Project API (Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone).


* **Font:** Monospace "Courier New" for maximum readability.
